Step 1:-Start.
Step 2:-Take the input from user for number of values in series and Save it in a veriable.
Step 3:-initilize first variable as 0 , and second variable as 1.
Step 3:-If the user enters any non integer value.Then ask user to enter correct value.
step 4:-if user enters 1 then display 0 as and output as first element of fibonachi series. 
step 5:-if user enters a positive integer then enter the loop .
        and display first number and add first and second veriable and store value in 
        temp variable. 
step 6:-Then we need to update the value of first variable as second and second variable as
        temp variable value.
Step 7:-And the series will get in output.
Step 8:-Loop will end.
Step 9:-End of the program.
